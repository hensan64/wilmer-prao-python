# INSTRUCTION:
#
# Create a Rock/Scissors/Paper game, where you play against the computer
#    1. Print the options: 1=Rock, 2=Scissors, 3=Paper
#    2. Read a digit (1, 2, 3) from the CONSOLE (representing Rock/Scissors/Paper)
#    3. Check that no other digit than (1, 2, 3) is being entered.
#       If a faulty value was added, print an error message and read a digit once again
#    4. Calculate the computer choice (1, 2, 3) by using RANDOM function, and print it
#    5. Calculate who won the round ('if' or 'case' clause)
#    6. Print a WIN/LOOSE statement
#
#    Additional tasks if you have time:
#    7. Handle multiple rounds (using a loop)
#    8. The person that reaches 5 won rounds (check with 'if' clause) wins all over, and this shall be printed
#
# TIP: Do one point at the time and test that it works before moving on to the next point
